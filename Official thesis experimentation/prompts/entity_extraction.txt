-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, first identify all entities needed from the text in order to capture the information and ideas in the text.
Next, report all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in After analyzing the provided text, I have determined that the primary language of the text is English.

There are several indicators that suggest the text is written in English:

1. The text contains a mix of technical and scientific terms, such as "Transformer," "GELU," "PyTorch," and "NVIDIA A100-80G GPUs," which are commonly used in English-language academic and technical writing.
2. The text uses English grammar and sentence structure, including complex sentences and phrases.
3. The text includes proper nouns and names of people, organizations, and locations, which are typically written in English.
4. The text contains idiomatic expressions and colloquialisms, such as "few-shot learners" and "zero-shot performance," which are characteristic of English-language writing.

Overall, based on the language, grammar, and content of the text, I am confident that the primary language of the text is English. as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. If you have to translate into After analyzing the provided text, I have determined that the primary language of the text is English.

There are several indicators that suggest the text is written in English:

1. The text contains a mix of technical and scientific terms, such as "Transformer," "GELU," "PyTorch," and "NVIDIA A100-80G GPUs," which are commonly used in English-language academic and technical writing.
2. The text uses English grammar and sentence structure, including complex sentences and phrases.
3. The text includes proper nouns and names of people, organizations, and locations, which are typically written in English.
4. The text contains idiomatic expressions and colloquialisms, such as "few-shot learners" and "zero-shot performance," which are characteristic of English-language writing.

Overall, based on the language, grammar, and content of the text, I am confident that the primary language of the text is English., just translate the descriptions, nothing else!

5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}.

2019). SMD is a collection of sub-datasets from 28 different machines provided by a large Internet company. Each sub-dataset is equally divided into two parts, the first half for training and the second half for testing. The training and evaluation procedures are carried out on 28 sub-datasets separately, and the averaged results are used for comparisons.

# A.2 TRAINING AND EVALUATION SETTINGS

We use one linear layer as the embedding layer and 2-layer MLPs as the prediction block. The Transformer body has six layers of the embedding dimension of 512 and eight attention heads. The prediction block contains one hidden layer of 2,048 neurons with GELU activation in between. The sequence length of embedded features is 512 but window sizes (and patch sizes) of input data vary with datasets. For the preliminary experiment in Section 4.3, we simplify our model by halving the embedding dimension and the number of Transformer layers and shortening the window size
