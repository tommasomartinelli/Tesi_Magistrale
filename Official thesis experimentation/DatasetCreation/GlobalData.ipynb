They fill in missing values using interpolation or generate multiple possible futures to account for data gaps. Some models also use attention mechanisms that dynamically focus on available data points, reducing the impact of missing data. These techniques improve the robustness of forecasting models in real-world applications where data quality is often a challenge.\")"

    "\"The Foundation Models for Time Series Data paper introduces solutions for generalizing time-series forecasting tasks by leveraging large-scale pretraining across diverse datasets. The foundation models like TimeGPT and TimesFM are compared with traditional deep learning models and statistical approaches, demonstrating superior performance in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. Tests conducted include forecasting on a variety of real-world benchmarks and synthetic datasets, where these models show significant improvements in accuracy, scalability, and generalization across domains. The models are evaluated for their ability to handle long-term dependencies, probabilistic forecasting, and missing data.\")"
