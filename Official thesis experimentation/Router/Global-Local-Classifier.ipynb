    "\n",
    "Context:\n",
    "We are analyzing a set of 9 papers related to time-series models. The titles of the 9 papers are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. TranAD\n",
    "2. AnomalyBERT\n",
    "3. RestAD\n",
    "4. TimeGPT\n",
    "5. TimeLLM\n",

    "- **Local questions**: These questions focus on specific details found within a single paper. These questions often reference sections, figures, or tables of a document. They do not require synthesizing information from multiple papers on the list, even if they involve comparisons between different methods within the same paper.\n",
    " Characteristics of Local Questions:\n",
    "  1. They reference specific sections, tables, or figures within a single document.\n",
    "  2. Formed sometimes by very specific questions, dealing with very particular technical details.\n",
    "  3. If it says 'according to the abstract of the paper... ', 'in accordance with table ..', 'according to section ..', the specific chapter, or uses phrases like that, the question is almost certainly local.\n",
    "  4. They do not require synthesizing information from multiple papers on the list, even if they involve comparisons between different methods within the same paper.\n",
    "  5. Sometimes it focuses on detailed results, scores, metrics, precise comparisons with numerical results.\n",
    " Examples of local questions:\n",
    "    1. \"What is the architecture of the model described in Section 4 of the paper?\"\n",
    "    2. \"How does the model's performance in Table 2 compare to other baselines presented in the same paper?\"\n",
    "    3. \"What preprocessing steps are necessary for the model described in this paper to handle seasonal data?\"\n",
    "    4. \"What evaluation metrics were used in the analysis presented in Section 5 of the paper?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Global questions**: These questions require the synthesis of information. They require understanding an entire paper and synthesizing it, or they require comparisons between the papers mentioned above. Global questions are also those that address general themes common to all papers.\n",
    " Characteristics of Global Questions:\n",
    "  1. They compare or reference multiple papers or models from the list of 9 papers.\n",
    "  2. They often ask about the trade-offs, similarities, or differences between methods from different documents on the list.\n",
    "  3. They require a broader understanding or a synthesis of information across papers or models from the list.\n",
    "  4. They can also be just about a specific paper but require a summary or the main contents of the paper \n",
    " Examples of Global Questions (synthetic examples):\n",
    "    1. \"How does the model Y compare to model Z for anomaly detection?\"\n",
    "    2. \"What are the key differences between the forecasting models described in Papers C and D?\"\n",
    "    3. \"How do the models from Paper F and Paper I handle non-stationary data, and why is this important?\"\n",
    "    4. \"How does Model X work?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional Instructions:\n",
    " - If different papers, found in the list posed above, are mentioned in the question, the question will definitely be “global”.\n",
    " - If the question includes a comparison but one of the models mentioned is not in the list of papers, then it refers to a comparison within a paper and the question is “local”.\n",
    " - If the question mentions a specific section of a paper, such as the abstract, chapter number, table, code, image, or other, the question will definitely be “local”.\n",

Our model converts multivariate data points into temporal representations with relative position bias and yields anomaly scores from these representations. Our method, AnomalyBERT, shows a great capability of detecting anomalies contained in complex time series and surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods on five real-world benchmarks. Our code is available at https://github.com/Jhryu30/AnomalyBERT.\\n\\n# 4.4 MAIN RESULTS\\n\\nWe report the results of AnomalyBERT on the five real-world datasets introduced in Section 4.1, and compare them to those of the previous works. The reproduced evaluation scores are brought from Kim et al. (2022). In Table 2, we show that AnomalyBERT outperforms the previous methods on\\n# Presented at the ICLR 2023 workshop on Machine Learning for IoT: Datasets, Perception, and Understanding\\n\\n# Table 2: F1-scores for various anomaly detection methods and AnomalyBERT on five benchmark datasets.\\n\\nWe report the standard F1 and F1-scores after point adjustment (F1PA) following the protocol in Kim et al.

Our method, AnomalyBERT, predicts anomaly scores that quantify abnormalities of data points in time series. We also visualize the original data and the final latent features in our model using t-SNE and show that our method separates abnormal points effectively.\\n\\n|(a) Abnormal component of the original data|(b) 2D-visualization of the original data and latent features in our model.|\\n|---|---|\\n|Predicted Score|Latent feature|\\n|Normal|Abnormal|\\n|Normal|Abnormal|\\n\\n# 1 INTRODUCTION\\n\\nIn many industrial environments, time series data is mainly dealt with to monitor machines, IT devices, spacecrafts, or engines. Anomaly detection is one of the essential tasks for time series analysis, which can find defects in machines and prevent potential harm. Recently, many deep learning-based approaches have been applied to this work. Several studies design recurrent neural networks.\\n\\n# Table 1: Examination of relationships between the typical types of outliers in Lai et al.

Without any post-processing, our method finds out diverse types of anomalies.\\n\\n# B VISUAL RESULTS\\n\\nWe visualize the prediction results of AnomalyBERT and present the 2D projections of the original data and latent features in the model. Similar to Figure 1, we select three abnormal windows in each of SWaT, WADI, and SMAP test sets and fetch the corresponding anomaly scores after the score prediction process. We then project the original data points and the last latent features from the abnormal windows into 2D planes using t-SNE. As shown in Figure 5, our method distinguishes anomalies successfully and separates abnormal data points from normal points well.\\n\\n# SWaT\\n\\n# WADI\\n\\n# SMAP\\n\\n# Figure 5: Visualization of anomaly score predictions on abnormal sequences in SWaT, WADI, and SMAP datasets.\\n\\nQuestion:\\nHow does AnomalyBERT work?\\n\\nAnswer:\\n', 'model': 'meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct', 'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 500, 'repetition_penalty': 1.2, 'stop': [\"I don't know.\"]}\n",

This work opens up various research avenues, some of which we discuss below.\\n\\n# 6.1 Beyond Zero-shot Univariate Forecasting\\n\\n# Fine tuning\\n\\nMotivated by the remarkable zero-shot performance of Chronos models, we conducted a preliminary investigation into fine-tuning Chronos models individually on datasets from Benchmark II.\\n\\n|Chronos-T5 (Small)|Zero Shot|Fine Tuned|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|WQL|0.672|0.608|\\n|MASE|0.856|0.782|\\n\\n.

We also conducted experiments with the decoder-only GPT-2 model to demonstrate the applicability of the Chronos framework to decoder-only models. In the following, we discuss the training configurations used for our main results (Section 5.5) and explore alternatives for some of the hyperparameters in Section 5.6.\\n\\nOur comprehensive evaluation across 42 datasets establishes Chronos as a benchmark for both in-domain and zero-shot forecasting, surpassing both traditional models and task-specific deep learning approaches. Notably, Chronos achieves impressive zero-shot forecasting performance out of the box, without necessitating task-specific adjustments. Its accuracy, coupled with its relatively modest model size, positions it as a preferable alternative to larger, more computationally demanding models for zero-shot forecasting applications.\\n# cations.

While both language and time series are sequential in nature, they differ in terms of their representation — natural language consists of words from a finite\\n# 3.1 Time Series Tokenization\\n\\nConsider a time series x1:C+H = [x1, . . . , xC+H], where the first C time steps constitute the historical context, and the remaining H represent the forecast horizon. Language models operate on tokens from a finite vocabulary, so using them for time series data requires mapping the observations xi ∈ R to a finite set of tokens. To this end, we first scale and then quantize observations into a fixed number of bins.\\n\\n# Scaling\\n\\n. Chronos tokenizes time series into discrete bins through simple scaling and quantization of real values. In this way, we can train off-the-shelf language models on this “language of time series,” with no changes to the model architecture (see Figure 1 for a high-level depiction of Chronos). Remarkably, this straightforward approach proves to be effective and efficient, underscoring the potential for language model architectures to address a broad range of time series problems with minimal modifications.\\n\\n. An example of this behaviour is given in Figure 16b. Improving the tokenization to overcome these edge cases is subject for future work, but the results from Section 5.5 suggest that the Chronos models performs well on real-world data despite the limitations.\\n\\nIn this section, we analyze forecasts generated by Chronos models qualitatively, and we also highlight some limitations of our tokenization technique. We primarily focus on synthetically generated time series for a controlled analysis of different types of time series patterns. For example forecasts from real datasets, see Figures 22 to 24 in Appendix E.\\n\\n# I.I.D. Noise.\\n\\nWe generated time series comprised purely of Gaussian observations, N (0, 1) and N (100, 10), and used Chronos-T5 (Base) to forecast these.

TimeGPT takes a window of historical values to produce the forecast, adding local positional encoding to enrich the input. The architecture consists of an encoder-decoder structure with multiple layers, each with residual connections and layer normalization. Finally, a linear layer maps the decoder’s output to the forecasting window dimension. The general intuition is that attention-based mechanisms are able to capture the diversity of past events and correctly extrapolate potential future distributions.\\n\\n# 5.3 Training TimeGPT\\n\\nTimeGPT underwent a multi-day training period on a cluster of NVIDIA A10G GPUs. During this process, we carried out extensive hyperparameter exploration to optimize learning rates, batch sizes, and other related parameters. We observed a pattern in alignment with findings from [Brown et al., 2020], where a larger batch size and a smaller learning rate proved beneficial.

On the other hand, global models such as LGBM, LSTM, and NHITS demonstrated a more prolonged average of 57 milliseconds per series, considering both training and inference. Due to its zero-shot capabilities, TimeGPT outperforms traditional statistical methods and global models with total speed by orders of magnitude.\\n\\n# 7 Discussion and Future Research\\n\\nTimeGPT was benchmarked against a broad spectrum of baseline, statistical, machine learning, and neural forecasting models to provide a comprehensive performance analysis. Baselines and statistical models are individually trained on each time series of the test set, utilizing the historical values preceding the last forecasting window. We opted for a global model approach for machine learning and deep learning methods for each frequency, leveraging all time series in the test set. Some popular models like Prophet [Taylor and Letham, 2018] and ARIMA were excluded from the analysis due to their prohibitive computational requirements and extensive training times.\\n\\n# 7 Discussion and Future Research\\n\\nCurrent forecasting practice usually involves a complex pipeline, encompassing multiple steps from data processing to model training and selection. TimeGPT greatly simplifies this process by reducing pipelines to the inference step, substantially reducing complexity and time investment while still achieving state-of-the-art performance. Perhaps most significantly, TimeGPT democratizes the advantages of large transformers models, nowadays restricted to organizations with vast amounts of data, computational resources, and technical expertise.

This training set incorporates time series from a broad array of domains, including finance, economics, demographics, healthcare, weather, IoT sensor data, energy, web traffic, sales, transport, and banking. Due to this diverse set of domains, the training dataset contains time series with a wide range of characteristics.\\n\\nWe trained T5 models of 4 sizes, namely, Mini (20M), Small (46M), Base (200M) and Large (710M), and the GPT-2 base model (90M), on 10M TSMixup augmentations generated from the 28 training datasets, with K = 3 in Algorithm 1, and 1M synthetic time series generated using Gaussian processes. Note that with this setup, original time series are adequately represented since they are included in the TSMixup augmentations with probability 1/3. We sampled time series from the augmentations and synthetic data in the ratio 9:1 during training. Each model is trained with an effective batch size of 256 sequences, using distributed data parallelism and gradient accumulation, whenever necessary. These sequences are constructed by slicing random windows from the time series, and then scaling and quantizing them into equal-sized bins within the interval [l= − 15, r=15], as described in Section 3.1\\n\\n.1.

Each patch along is processed into a vector by a residual block (as defined in the model definition) to the model dimension of the transformer layers. The vector is then added to positional encodings and fed into nl stacked transformer layers. SA refers to self-attention (note that we use multi-head causal attention) and FFN is the fully connected layer in the transformer. The output tokens are then mapped through a residual block to an output of size output_patch_len, which is the forecast for the time window following the last input patch seen by the model so far.\\n\\n# Network\\n\\n# A PREPRINT\\n\\nIn particular, we design TimesFM, a single foundation model for time-series forecasting that, when applied to a variety of previously-unseen forecasting datasets across different domains, obtains close to state-of-the-art zero-shot accuracy (compared to the best supervised models trained individually for these datasets). Our model can work well across different forecasting history lengths, prediction lengths and time granularities at inference time. The key elements of our foundation model are twofold: 1) a large-scale time-series corpus built using both real-world (mostly time-series data from web search queries1 and Wikipedia page visits2) and synthetic data, which meets the volume and diversity of data needed for training our foundation model, and 2) a decoder style attention architecture with input patching, that can be efficiently pre-trained on this time-series corpus.\\n\\n# Table 3: Datasets used in the pretraining corpus and the unseen datasets on which we evaluate, grouped by the domains they are labelled against.\\n\\n|Transport & Tourism|Energy|Nature|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Pretraining|San Francisco Traffic|Australian Electricity Demand|\\n| |Uber TLC Hourly|Electricity Hourly|\\n| |London Smart Meters|Solar|\\n| |Wind Farms|ETT H1|\\n| |ETT H2|ETT M1|\\n| |ETT M2| |\\n|Unseen|Pedestrian Counts|ETT M2|\\n| | |Weather|\\n|Air Quality|Cloud|Banking & Econ|\\n|Beijing Multisite|CPU Limit Minute| |\\n|UCI|CPU Usage Minute| |\\n| |Function Delay Minute| |\\n| |Instances Minute| |\\n| |Memory Limit Minute| |\\n| |Memory Usage Minute| |\\n|Beijing PM2.5|Requests Minute|Exchange Rate|\\n| |Platform Delay Minute| |\\n\\n# Table 4: Statistics of all the datasets used in the paper.

We can then replace the time series xt with {(xit - μi) / σi}t=1. We also incorporate μi and σi as time independent real-valued covariates for each token, to give the model information of the statistics of the inputs, which we call summary statistics.\\n\\n# 4.5.

We can combine different distribution heads with the representational capacity of the model to output the parameters ϕ of any parametric probability distribution. For our experiments, we adopt a Student’s t-distribution (Student, 1908) and output the three parameters corresponding to this distribution, namely its degrees of freedom, mean, and scale, with appropriate non-linearities to ensure the appropriate parameters stay positive.\\n\\n¶This is since a history of L points in time is needed for all points in the context, starting from the first point in the context.\\n# Lag-Llama\\n\\nas in LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023).

If the answer is not explicitly stated in the context, respond with \"I don\\'t know.\"\\n\\nContext:\\nOur contributions are significant in two key aspects. First, we show that existing language model architectures are capable of performing forecasting without time-series-specific customizations. This paves the way for accelerated progress by leveraging developments in the area of LLMs and through better data strategies. Second, on a practical level, the strong performance of Chronos models suggests that large (by forecasting standards) pretrained language models can greatly simplify forecasting pipelines without sacrificing accuracy, offering an inference-only alternative to the conventional approach involving training and tuning a model on individual tasks.\\n\\n# Acknowledgements\\n\\nTIME-LLM shows promise in adapting frozen large language models for time series forecasting by reprogramming time series data into text prototypes more natural for LLMs and providing natural language guidance via Prompt-as-Prefix to augment reasoning. Evaluations demonstrate the adapted LLMs can outperform specialized expert models, indicating their potential as effective time series machines. Our results also provide a novel insight that time series forecasting can be cast as yet another “language” task that can be tackled by an off-the-shelf LLM to achieve state-of-the-art performance through our Time-LLM framework. Further research should explore optimal reprogramming representations, enrich LLMs with explicit time series knowledge through continued pre-training, and build towards multimodal models with joint reasoning across time series, natural language, and other modalities\\n\\n# Easy optimization\\n\\nLLMs are trained once on massive computing and then can be applied to forecasting tasks without learning from scratch. Optimizing existing forecasting models often requires significant architecture search and hyperparameter tuning (Zhou et al., 2023b).\\n\\nIn summary, LLMs offer a promising path to make time series forecasting more general, efficient, synergistic, and accessible compared to current specialized modeling paradigms.

The core idea is to reprogram the input time series into text prototype representations that are more naturally suited to language models’ capabilities. To further augment the model’s reasoning about time series concepts, we introduce Prompt-as-Prefix (PaP), a novel idea in enriching the input time series with additional context and providing task instructions in the modality of natural language. This provides declarative guidance about desired transformations to apply to the reprogrammed input. The output of the language model is then projected to generate time series forecasts.\\n\\n# Table 7: Efficiency analysis of TIME-LLM on ETTh1 in forecasting different steps ahead.\\n\\n|Length| |ETTh1-96| | |ETTh1-192| |ETTh1-336|ETTh1-512| | | | | | | |\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Metric|Param.

Examples include repurposing a vision model to work with cross-domain images (Misra et al., 2023) or reprogramming an acoustic model to handle time series data (Yang et al., 2021). In both cases, there are explicit, learnable transformations between the source and target data, allowing for the direct editing of input samples. However, time series can neither be directly edited nor described losslessly in natural language, posing significant challenges to directly bootstrap the LLM for understanding time series without resource-intensive fine-tuning.\\n\\n# Patch Reprogramming.\\n\\nHere we reprogram patch embeddings into the source data representation space to align the modalities of time series and natural language to activate the backbone’s time series understanding and reasoning capabilities. A common practice is learning a form of “noise” that, when applied to target input samples, allows the pre-trained source model to produce the desired target outputs without requiring parameter updates. This is technically feasible for bridging data.\\n# Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\n\\n# 0.6\\n\\n|Source|Target|the next value is|Projection|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Vocab.|Prototypes|0.6|Pre-trained LLM|\\n|time|Patch Embeddings!| |Pre-trained LLM (Body + LM Head)|\\n|late| | | |\\n|early|Patch 1| | |\\n|down|Patch 2| | |\\n|up|…| | |\\n|steady|Patch| |Pre-trained LLM|\\n|short|Reprogram| |Pre-trained LLM (Text Embedder)|\\n|long|Patch 5| |Reprogram|\\n\\n# (a) Patch Reprogramming\\n\\n# (b) Patch-as-Prefix and Prompt-as-Prefix\\n\\n# Input statistics:\\n\\n- &lt;time series statistic 1&gt;\\n- &lt;time series statistic 2&gt; …\\n\\n# Frozen Training\\n\\n# Prompt Embeddings\\n\\n# Patch Embeddings\\n\\n# Forward\\n\\n# Backward\\n\\nFigure 2: The model framework of TIME-LLM.\\nGiven an input time series, we first tokenize and embed it via 1 patching along with a 2 customized embedding layer. 3 These patch embeddings are then reprogrammed with condensed text prototypes to align two modalities.

Then, we divide X(i) into several consecutive overlapped or non-overlapped patches (Nie et al., 2023) with length Lp; thus the total number of input patches is P = ⌊ (T −Lp)⌋ + 2, where S denotes the horizontal sliding stride. The underlying motivations are two-fold: (1) better preserving local semantic information by aggregating local information into each patch and (2) serving as tokenization to form a compact sequence of input tokens, reducing computational burdens. Given these patches XP ∈ RP ×Lp, we embed them as XP ∈ RP ×dm, adopting a simple linear layer as the patch embedder to create dimensions dm.\\n\\n# Patch Reprogramming.\\n\\n# Cross-modality Alignment\\n\\nOur results indicate that ablating either patch reprogramming or Prompt-as-Prefix hurts knowledge transfer in reprogramming the LLM for effective time series forecasting. In the absence of representation alignment, we observe a notable average performance degradation of 9.2%, which becomes more pronounced (exceeding 17%) in few-shot tasks. In TIME-LLM, the act of prompting stands as a pivotal element in harnessing the LLM’s capacity for understanding the inputs and tasks. Ablation of this component results in over 8% and 19% degradation in standard and few-shot forecasting tasks, respectively. We find that removing the input statistics hurts the most, resulting in an average increase of 10.2% MSE.\\n# Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\n\\n# Table 6: Ablations on ETTh1 and ETTm1 in predicting 96 and 192 steps ahead (MSE reported).

Besides, the prompt can also be parameterized vectors and end-to-end learnable when optimizing the model on target datasets [10, 83]. In comparison to static prompts, the use of trainable prompts enhances the ability of LLMs to comprehend and match the context of given time series inputs. For example, TEMPO [10] constructs a trainable prompt pool with distinct key-value pairs, and retrieves the most representative prompt candidates with the highest similarity scores.\\n\\n# Table 7: Efficiency analysis of TIME-LLM on ETTh1 in forecasting different steps ahead.\\n\\n|Length| |ETTh1-96| | |ETTh1-192| |ETTh1-336|ETTh1-512| | | | | | | |\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Metric|Param.

The correlated results can be found in Fig. 6. From our analysis, we derive the following observations:\\n\\nWe provide additional technical details of TIME-LLM in three aspects: (1) the learning of text prototypes, (2) the calculation of trends and lags in time series for use in prompts, and (3) the implementation of the output projection. To identify a small set of text prototypes E′ ∈ RV ′×D from E ∈ RV ×D, we learn a matrix W ∈ RV ′×V as the intermediary. To describe the overall time series trend in natural language, we calculate the sum of differences between consecutive time steps. A sum greater than 0 indicates an upward trend, while a lesser sum denotes a downward trend. In addition, we calculate the top-5 lags of the time series, identified by computing the autocorrelation using fast Fourier transformation and selecting the five lags with the highest correlation values. After we pack and feedforward the prompt and patch embeddings O(i) ∈ RP ×D through the frozen LLM, we discard the prefixal part and obtain the output representations, denoted as Oi ∈ RP ×D\\n\\nQuestion:\\nWhat are the three pivotal components for constructing effective prompts in TIME-LLM, as described in the paper?\\n\\nAnswer:\\n', 'model': 'meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct', 'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 500, 'repetition_penalty': 1.2, 'stop': [\"I don't know.\"]}\n",

HitRate@P% is the measure of how many ground truth dimensions have been included in the top candidates predicted by the model [45]. P% is the percentage of the ground truth dimensions for each timestamp, which we use to consider the top predicted candidates. For instance, if at timestamp t, if 2 dimensions are labeled anomalous in the ground truth, HitRate@100% would consider top 2 dimensions and HitRate@150% would consider 3 dimensions (100 and 150 are chosen based on prior work [62]).

Performance is evaluated using the F1-score for threshold-dependent evaluation.

For threshold-independent analysis, we use AUC-ROC, AUC-PR, VUS-ROC, and VUS-PR metrics [21]. We exclude the point-adjustment method [22] due to its overestimation [23].

However, we use insightful refactoring of the transformer architecture for the task of anomaly detection in time-series data. Just like other encoder-decoder models, in a transformer, an input sequence undergoes several attention-based transformations. Figure 1 shows the architecture of the neural network used in TranAD. The encoder encodes the complete sequence until the current timestamp 𝐶 with a focus score (more details later).

Finally, Section 6 concludes.\\n\\n# 2 Related Work\\n\\nTime series anomaly detection is a long-studied problem in the VLDB community. The prior literature works on two types of time-series data: univariate and multivariate. For the former, various methods analyze and detect anomalies in time-series data with a single data source [34], while for the latter multiple time-series together [14, 45, 62].\\n\\n# Classical methods\\n\\nThe recently proposed HitAnomaly [19] method uses vanilla transformers as encoder-decoder networks, but is only applicable to natural-language log data and not appropriate for generic continuous time-series data as inputs. In our experiments, we compare TranAD against the state-of-the-art methods MERLIN, LSTM-NDT, DAGMM, OmniAnomaly, MSCRED, MAD-GAN, USAD, MTAD-GAT, CAE-M and GDN. These methods have shown superiority in anomaly detection and diagnosis, but complement one another in terms of performance across different time-series datasets. Out of these, only USAD aims to reduce training times, but does this to a limited extent. Just like reconstruction based prior work [4, 29, 45, 60, 61], we develop a TranAD model that learns broad level trends using training data to find anomalies in test data. We specifically improve anomaly detection and diagnosis performance with also reducing the training times in this work.\\n\\n# 3 Methodology\\n\\n# 3.1 Problem Formulation\\n\\nThis work uses various tools, including Transformer neural networks and model-agnostic meta learning, as building blocks. However, each of these different technologies cannot be directly used and need necessary adaptations to create a generalizable model for anomaly detection. Specifically, we propose a transformer-based anomaly detection model (TranAD), that uses self-conditioning and an adversarial training process. Its architecture makes it fast for training and testing while maintaining stability with large input sequences. Simple transformer-based encoder-decoder networks tend to miss anomalies if the deviation is too small, i.e., it is relatively close to normal data. One of our contributions is to show that this can be alleviated by an adversarial training procedure that can amplify reconstruction errors. Further, using self-conditioning for robust multi-modal feature extraction can help gain training stability and allow generalization [32]\\n\\nEfficient anomaly detection and diagnosis in multivariate time-series data is of great importance for modern industrial applications. However, building a system that is able to quickly and accurately pinpoint anomalous observations is a challenging problem. This is due to the lack of anomaly labels, high data volatility and the demands of ultra-low inference times in modern applications. Despite the recent developments of deep learning approaches for anomaly detection, only a few of them can address all of these challenges. In this paper, we propose TranAD, a deep transformer network based anomaly detection and diagnosis model which uses attention-based sequence encoders to swiftly perform inference with the knowledge of the broader temporal trends in the data. TranAD uses focus score-based self-conditioning to enable robust multi-modal feature extraction and adversarial training to gain stability\\n\\nQuestion:\\nWhat is the problem formulation for anomaly detection and diagnosis in the paper \\'TranAD\\'?\\n\\nAnswer:\\n', 'model': 'meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct', 'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 500, 'repetition_penalty': 1.2, 'stop': [\"I don't know.\"]}\n",

(2)\\n\\nHere, the softmax forms the convex combination weights for the values in 𝑉, allowing us to compress the matrix 𝑉 into a smaller representative embedding for simplified inference in the downstream neural network operations. Unlike traditional attention operation, the scaled-dot product attention scales the weights by a √𝑚 term to reduce the variance of the weights, facilitating stable training [51]. For input matrices 𝑄, 𝐾 and 𝑉, we apply Multi-Head Self Attention [51] by first passing it through ℎ (number of heads) feed-forward layers to get 𝑄𝑖, 𝐾𝑖 and 𝑉𝑖 for 𝑖 ∈ {1, . . . , ℎ}, and then applying scaled-dot product attention as:\\n\\nWe now describe the adversarial training process and the two-phase inference approach in the TranAD model, summarized in Algorithm 1.\\n\\n# Phase 1 - Input Reconstruction\\n\\nThe Transformer model enables us to predict the reconstruction of each input time-series window.
