            "question": "How does AnomalyBERT work?",
            "answer": "Our model converts multivariate data points into temporal representations with relative position bias and yields anomaly scores from these representations. This means that AnomalyBERT takes input data points and transforms them into a format that captures their temporal structure and positional relationships within the data stream. It then generates anomaly scores for each data point, indicating how likely it is to be anomalous. By doing so, AnomalyBERT enables effective anomaly detection in complex time-series data. \n\nNote: There's no explicit explanation about how exactly AnomalyBERT achieves its goal but according to the given text, it uses some form of transformation followed by scoring.
