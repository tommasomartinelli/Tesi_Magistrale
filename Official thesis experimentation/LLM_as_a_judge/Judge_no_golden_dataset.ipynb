The importance of handling non-stationarity lies in accurately capturing dynamic trends and variations inherent in real-time series data, enabling effective identification of anomalies that may arise due to changes in underlying processes. I don't know if there's more explicit discussion regarding this aspect in other parts of the paper or supplementary materials mentioned but isn't covered here.
