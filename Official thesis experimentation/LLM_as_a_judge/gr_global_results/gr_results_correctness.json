Sensitivity to Outliers\n\nAnomaly detection models may be sensitive to outliers, which can lead to incorrect anomaly detection. This is particularly challenging in financial datasets, where outliers can be indicative of legitimate transactions or events. [Data: Reports (75, 335, 157, 87, 22, +more)]\n\n## 2. Complex Relationships between Variables\n\nFinancial datasets often have complex relationships between variables, making it challenging to identify anomalies. This complexity can lead to poor performance of anomaly detection models, as they may struggle to capture the nuances of the data. [Data: Reports (75, 335, 157, 87, 22, +more)]\n\n## 3. Non-Stationary Patterns and Trends\n\nFinancial datasets often exhibit non-stationary patterns or trends, which can negatively impact the performance of anomaly detection models. These models may not be able to capture the changes in the data over time, leading to false positives or false negatives. [Data: Reports (213, 283, 284, 368, +more)]\n\n## 4. High Noise Levels or Missing Values\n\nAnomaly detection models may not perform well on financial datasets with high noise levels or missing values. This can lead to poor performance or incorrect results, as the models may struggle to handle the noisy or incomplete data. [Data: Reports (75, 335, 157, 87, 22, +more)]\n\n## 5. High Dimensionality\n\nFinancial datasets often have a high dimensionality, making it challenging to identify relevant features for anomaly detection. This can lead to overfitting or poor performance, as the models may struggle to capture the complex relationships between variables. [Data: Reports (213, 283, 284, 368, +more)]\n\n## 6. Choice of Anomaly Detection Algorithm\n\nThe choice of anomaly detection algorithm may not be suitable for the specific financial dataset, leading to poor performance. This highlights the importance of selecting the right algorithm for the task at hand, taking into account the characteristics of the data. [Data: Reports (212, 155)]\n\n## 7.
