        "generated_answer": "The Chronos framework tokenizes time series values through simple scaling and quantization of real values. This involves two main steps:\n\nFirstly, it scales the time series observations.\nSecondly, it quantizes the scaled observations into a fixed number of bins.\n\nThis process allows Chronos to map the continuous time series data onto a finite set of tokens, which enables the use of pre-existing language models without modifying their architecture. The resulting tokenized time series can then be processed by standard language models like T5 (as demonstrated in Figure 12a). \n\nNote that while this method has proven effective and efficient, there may still exist certain edge cases or limitations that require further improvement, particularly when dealing with more complex time series patterns. However, according to the text, even with its current state, the Chronos models perform reasonably well on real-world data, as seen in figures 22 to 24 in appendix E. \nAlso note that improving the tokenization technique is considered an area for future research.",
        "reference_answer": "Chronos tokenizes time series values by first scaling and then quantizing observations into a fixed number of bins. The scaling is done using mean scaling, which normalizes individual entries of the time series by the mean of the absolute values in the historical context. The quantization is done by selecting B bin centers and B-1 edges, and mapping the real values to discrete tokens based on these bins.",

        "generated_answer": "According to Section 4.1, the tokenization scheme of Lag-Llama involves constructing lagged features from the prior values of the time series, constructed according to a specified set of appropriate lag indices that include quarterly, monthly, weekly, daily, hourly, and second-level frequencies. Specifically, given a sorted set of positive lag indices L = {1,..., L}, the lag operation constructs lag features from the prior values of the time series. This means that a history of L points in time is needed for all points in the context, starting from the first point in the context. Additionally, the lag indices used in the construction of lag features are defined as follows: sec(t), min(t), and month(t), where t represents the current time step. Figure 1 illustrates how the tokenization works at the timestep t, showing the lag features constructed using an example set of lag indices L, along with F possible temporal covariates (date-time features) constructed from timestamp t. Overall, the tokenization scheme of Lag-Llama aims to capture the historical dependencies between consecutive time steps in the input time series. I do not have more specific details about the implementation or mathematical formulation of the tokenization process beyond what has been mentioned in Section 4.1.

It consists of M decoder layers, where a univariate sequence of length x_i - L:C along with its covariates is tokenized by concatenating the covariate vectors to a sequence of C tokens x_1:C. These tokens are then passed through a shared linear projection layer that maps the features to the hidden dimension of the attention module. Additionally, it incorporates pre-normalization via the RMSNorm (Zhang & Sennrich, 2019) and Rotary Positional Encoding (RoPE) (Su et al., 2021) at each attention layer's query and key representations.

The total number of input patches is calculated as P = \u230a(T - Lp)/S\u230b + 2, where T represents the length of the input time series and S denotes the horizontal sliding stride.\n\nThe underlying motivation behind dividing the input channels into patches is twofold: (1) to preserve local semantic information by aggregating local information into each patch, and (2) to serve as tokenization to form a compact sequence of input tokens, thereby reducing computational burdens.\n\nFinally, the patches XP \u2208 R^(P x Lp) are embedded as XP \u2208 R^(P x dm), utilizing a simple linear layer as the patch embedder to create dimensions dm.

By exploiting synthetic outliers generated through this scheme during the training phase, the model learns to distinguish between anomalous and non-anomalous behavior.

        "generated_answer": "This work uses various tools, including Transformer neural networks and model-agnostic meta learning, as building blocks. However, each of these different technologies cannot be directly used and need necessary adaptations to create a generalizable model for anomaly detection. Specifically, we propose a transformer-based anomaly detection model (TranAD), that uses self-conditioning and an adversarial training process. Its architecture makes it fast for training and testing while maintaining stability with large input sequences. Simple transformer-based encoder-decoder networks tend to miss anomalies if the deviation is too small, i.e., it is relatively close to normal data. One of our contributions is to show that this can be alleviated by an adversarial training procedure that can amplify reconstruction errors. Further, using self-conditioning for robust multi-modal feature extraction can help gain training stability and allow generalization [32]. Efficient anomaly detection and diagnosis in multivariate time-series data is of great importance for modern industrial applications. However, building a system that is able to quickly and accurately pinpoint anomalous observations is a challenging problem. This is due to the lack of anomaly labels, high data volatility and the demands of ultra-low inference times in modern applications. Despite the recent developments of deep learning approaches for anomaly detection, only a few of them can address all of these challenges. In this paper, we propose TranAD, a deep transformer network based anomaly detection and diagnosis model which uses attention-based sequence encoders to swiftly perform inference with the knowledge of the broader temporal trends in the data. TranAD uses focus score-based self-conditioning to enable robust multi-modal feature extraction and adversarial training to gain stability. \n\nHowever, according to section 3.1, the specific problem formulation for anomaly detection and diagnosis in the paper 'TranAD' is:\n\n\"This work uses various tools, including Transformer neural networks and model-agnostic meta learning, as building blocks.\" I apologize for the lengthy previous response.
